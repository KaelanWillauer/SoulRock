#Bug Fixes
*The displayRiddle function displays the riddle twice. Adding a cls statment covers the error, so cls has been taken out.
*Finder scrolls do not stay on screen. A pause should be added after the finder scroll prompt.
*Leaderboard still contains an escape sequence from cloud9 version, which is printed to the screen.

##Features/Ideas
*New riddles
*Mini games instead of some of the riddles
*Timer
*Color
